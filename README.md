# Take-Screenshot
This JavaScript code is used to capture and download a screenshot of a specific HTML element on a webpage.

HTML:
In the HTML file, we define the structure of our app using various elements and classes. We have a wrapper div that contains two main sections: the container where the content and image are displayed, and the preview container where the captured screenshot is shown. Additionally, there are buttons for capturing the screenshot and downloading the image.

CSS:
The CSS file defines the styling for our app. We set a background color, font family, and spacing properties. We also apply styling to the container and preview container elements, as well as the buttons and links.

JavaScript:
The JavaScript code handles the main functionality of the screenshot capture app. It utilizes the html2canvas library to capture the screenshot of the container element when the capture button is clicked. The captured image is then displayed in the preview container, and the download button is updated with the necessary attributes to download the image.

Conclusion :
Overall, this code sets up a click event listener on a button. When the button is clicked, it captures a screenshot of a specific HTML element, displays a preview of the captured image, and provides a download link for the image.
